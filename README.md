# Reflection

### Design

 -  What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?
	   
	 - Using design methods to fully flesh out the, then hypothetical, bot helped to establish a framework that could be built upon throughout implementation.  The Use Case scenarios especially helped with understanding how the bot would need to function as preconditions would have to be met for the scenarios to happen, this is where we figure out that a boolean for isPlaying would have to be established and turned off and on throughout the bots usage for effective functionality. There are many other examples like this that would have been near impossible to figure out without having these conceptual mappings and use cases.
 -  What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
	 -  The most difficult portion of the design was certainly trying to incorporate all the ideas of the different team members into one concrete diagram or scenario. For example with the Sequence flow Diagram, all three of us had different opinions as to how things should flow within each other and it took a lot of time for us to flesh out a diagram that made sense to all three of us. Even though we were given a 100, i think both my group members would agree that more time could have been allocated to the Sequence diagram aswell as the Storyboard as we feel that they did not encompass everything that they could have.
    
 -  What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
    
	 - I think all the design methods used in the design section of this project are an integral part to any coding project, and I could not imagine forgetting any of them in my future projects. Especially the Use Case Scenarios and Sequence Flow diagram as they helped provide a majority of my understanding of how to actually implement the project.

### Implementation

 -  What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?
	 - The most helpful thing throughout our entire implementation process was most certainly making use of group coding. While all commits were technically "individual", no single commit that was made was done by one individual. Group coding allowed us to easily breeze past simple errors that a coder can sometimes get stuck on purely because it can be hard to recognize, ie things like missing semicolons or more specifically tabbing issues since we were working in python. This also helped with testing as the bot itself is designed to be used by multiple users at once so whenever anything was coded, we could also test immediately since there was no solo coding.
 - What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
	 - The most difficult aspect was finding times where we could all meet to code together, the major drawback of group coding is this complecation.  However, after some time Vinny discovered a site called whentomeet which allowed us all to input our schedules and then provided us times where we would all theoretically be available provided no extraneous plans. Going forward, I would most certainly utilize this site from the beginning and probably assign more simple/tedious tasks that would not need to be tested right away to make the group coding sessions a bit more productive.
   
 - What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want
   to try again in the future on another project?
	 - Without being too redundant, group coding was extremely effective, and since the three of us were also paired in another project we also made use of it there which also proved to be extremely effective.  Additionally, I think it was effective for us to define a seperate board/game class as to not clutter all work inside one file. On top of this, it helps to maintain a understandable architecture as it makes interaction between the discord implemation and the board/game class much more understandable. Going forward I will be using both of these techniques as they were fundamental in the development of the boggle bot.

    


### Process

 - What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in
   your project?
	 -	While we didn't necessarily use traditional kanban boards, having the similar process through our discord server gave us a concrete layout for what to do next as well as figuring out which tasks would need to be prioritized during our group sessions. Since we typically coded in pairs, the outlying member would be sent the additional code to test on their own device, since it had yet to be hosted, then they would review before we would then push to main. This was extremely helpful in pointing out any flaws that the pair could have missed as well as optimization issues that may not have been addressed.
 - What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
	 - The most difficult part of making use of these methodologies is that the kanban board would become cluttered very quickly as we all inputted things that could potentially be implented but there was no priority to the order of which they should be implemented which became confusing. In the future, I would assign points to each task as they are placed onto the board so that priority can be assigned easier and with less discussion.
     
 - What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?
    -	Going forward I will continue to use group coding as well as kanban boards and code reviews. Kanban boards provide structure throughout the implementation process, and code reviews prevent massive errors from heavily effecting the main repository as well as help to identify necessary changes that should be made.


### Overall

Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---**compare and contrast**  how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.

 - The design methods precede the other two concepts, this part is potentially the most integral as without it, the other two concepts are severely impacted because there will be no predetermined functional architecute to then base the implementation and proccesses off of. The other two concepts go hand in hand to compliment eachother. Software processes are for helping the coding processes go more smoothly in terms of workflow and designating tasks to group members. The Implementation practices helped for actual coding and getting the bot functioning in the most literal of senses. All three of these concepts are 100% necessary in doing projects effieciently and effectively.
